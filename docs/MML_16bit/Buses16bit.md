#MMLogic 16-bit CPU Overview

1. [Control Panel](https://grexel.github.io/JCompiler/MMLogic/MM1_ComputerModel).
This provides a look into the workings of the CPU. One can see Registers, Outputs, Program Counter, Instruction, Address , Memory data, Stack position, etc.

2. [Clock, Instructions, RAM](https://grexel.github.io/JCompiler/MMLogic/MM2_ModelClock).
This shows the main control structure for the CPU, demultiplexing the bits of the Instruction.

3. [Registers](https://grexel.github.io/JCompiler/MMLogic/MM3_ProgramCounter).
A look at the structure of the registers used by the CPU.

4. [ALU](https://grexel.github.io/JCompiler/MMLogic/MM4_CommandRegisters).
How the ALU is designed to allow add, add with carry, subtract, and subtract with borrow.

5. [Buses](https://grexel.github.io/JCompiler/MMLogic/MM5_Instructions).
The selectors and buses that control the data going into and out of the registers
