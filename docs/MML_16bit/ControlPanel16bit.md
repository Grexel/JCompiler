#MMLogic 16-bit Control Panel

##Main control panel 
![alt text][mainControlPanel]
The main control panel contains the ascii display, 4 output ports, and 4 registers.

##Secondary control panel
![alt text][secondaryControlPanel]
The secondary control panel contains displays for unique cpu registers in addition to the ascii display, one register, and input.
Running the simulation for any time on this page creates immediate severe glitching of the program. 
One may be able to get around this by slowing the clock down considerably.

##Device panel
![alt text][deviePanel]
The device panel only contains the keyboard input so far. In the future it may hold networks and drives.
