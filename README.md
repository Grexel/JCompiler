## Welcome to the JCompiler site.

This is a project aimed at creating a useable 16-bit MMLogic computer.
There is an assembly compiler, jasm, created using token->parse->compile methodology, along with a defunct one jeffasm.
In the works is a recursive descent parser for a simple higher level language dubbed JLang.

Under the docs folder will be a tutorial for modeling the computer in MMLogic.
